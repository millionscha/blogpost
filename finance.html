										<p>The adoption procedure for annual EU budgets involves three EU institutions: the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. <br>
											
											The process begins in February of the previous year, when the Council and the Parliament adopt their guidelines.
											
											The European Commission then presents the draft proposal to the Council and the Parliament, usually in May. <br>
											
											Between July and September, the Council establishes and adopts its position, and the Parliament then has one month to either approve or amend it.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The EU annual budget is usually adopted by the end of the previous year. If agreement cannot be reached, the new budget follows the ‘provisional twelfths’ rule: no more than one twelfth of the budget for the previous year can be spent each month.</p>
										<p>The Council agreed to the EU providing a total of €454.8 million in disaster relief aid to Romania and Italy to repair damage caused by natural disasters in 2022 and Türkiye, in relation to the earthquakes in February 2023.

											In practice, the EU will transfer money from the solidarity and emergency aid reserve in its 2023 budget to the 'EU Solidarity Fund' operational budget line, from where it can be paid to those countries.
											
											The financial aid will be paid out once the proposal has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.</p>

										<h3>Japanese deputy finance minister steps down over tax scandal</h3>
										<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.2dcd1f561c893537802848b931918f10?rik=V%2f8dUqrUnzucgw&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="" style="width: 90%;">
										<br>
										<br>
										<p>TOKYO (Reuters) -A Japanese deputy finance minister stepped down on Monday over revelations that he had been delinquent on tax payments, another blow to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida whose public support is languishing in the polls.
											<br>

											Kenji Kanda, state minister of finance in charge of government bonds and monetary policy, told reporters he had resigned because he did not want the issue to disrupt debate in parliament.
											<br>
											The legislature will soon deliberate on a 13.1 trillion yen ($86.34 billion) supplementary budget to fund the government's economic package.
											<br>

											The Shukan Bunshun magazine first reported last week that a private firm owned by Kanda, who is a licensed tax accountant, had repeatedly failed to pay taxes and authorities had foreclosed on a company building four times.
											
											<br>
											<br>
											Kanda said that the report was true.
											
											Kanda is the third official to leave a ministerial post in just two months since Kishida reshuffled his cabinet to improve tumbling public approval ratings.
											<br>
											
											"The government takes the resignations very seriously and will do its utmost to address the pressing issues in order to regain the trust of the public," top government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said of the three resignations.
											<br>
											
											Surveys indicate the prime minister has not managed to turn around the falling support.</p>

										<h3>Mars is paying $661 million for Britain’s biggest independent chocolate maker</h3>
										<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231116090721-hotel-chocolat-0923.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

								<p>London
									CNN
									 — 
									Mars is buying Hotel Chocolat in a deal that values Britain’s largest independent chocolate maker at £534 million ($661 million) and could boost its growth prospects outside of the United Kingdom.
									<br>
									
									News of the deal sent Hotel Chocolat’s shares up 164% Thursday to within striking distance of the offer price of 375 pence ($4.65) per share. <br> Mars’ cash offer represents a premium of almost 170% to the stock’s closing price on Wednesday — an amount one consultant described as “astounding.”
									<br>
									
									“The cash offer is… a ridiculous premium for what is fundamentally a business with limited future growth in the UK, and questionable performance internationally,” Jonathan De Mello, who runs UK-based retail consultancy JDM Retail, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
									<br>
									<br>
									
									Hotel Chocolat was founded in 1993 by entrepreneurs Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris who “were on a mission to make chocolate exciting again,” according to its website.
									<br>
									
									The brand opened its first store nearly 20 years ago in north London and has since grown to 131 UK stores, in addition to cafés and restaurants. It also has stores in Japan and a working cocoa farm, complete with a luxury eco-hotel, in the Caribbean.
									<br>
									
									In the most recent financial year, Hotel Chocolat posted what it described as “disappointing” financial results. The company’s revenue declined 10% to £205 million ($254 million) and it reported a loss of £6.2 million ($7.7 million).
									<br>
									br CEO Thirlwell, who will stay on under Mars, said the takeover would boost the brand’s growth prospects.</p>
								<h3>The end of another British brand</h3>
								<br>
								<p>The british are less convinced. The deal sparked a flurry of comments from X users lamenting the takeover of another homegrown British chocolate brand by a large American food company.

									Some drew parallels with the multi-billion dollar buyout in 2010 of Cadbury’s by Kraft Foods — which later became Mondelez International (MDLZ) — in a deal that ended nearly two centuries of independence for the iconic Birmingham-based firm.</p>

								<h1 class="Ho">Can government claim credit for fall in inflation?</h1>

										<br>
										<p>This morning the prime minister tweeted: "In January we said we'd halve inflation. Today we've done that - inflation is now 4.6%."

											When inflation started to accelerate early in 2022, Rishi Sunak as chancellor attributed the rise to global factors. Now as prime minister, he's claiming it as a success for government policy that it's come down.
											<br>
											
											However, leading economists are sceptical that the halving of inflation compared to last year has much to do with any government plan - or indeed is something within the government's power.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, an influential economics think tank, said: "The job of cutting inflation is for the Bank of England not the government. So it was always inappropriate for the government to have a target/pledge to halve inflation.
											<br>
											
											"That's not their job and not something over which they have a lot of control. It was an opportunistic pledge given the fact that Bank was, in January, forecasting that inflation would easily halve."</p>

												<br>
												<br>
										<p>A drop in petrol prices last month helped to drive US inflation to the lowest rate since July.

											Prices increased at a rate of 3.2% over the 12 months to October, the Labor Department said.
											
											That was down from 3.7% a month earlier.
											<br>
											
											Housing costs continued to climb, but overall price pressures were milder than analysts had expected, suggesting the country's fight against inflation may nearly be over.
											<br>
											<br>
											From September to October, the price index - which measures prices of a basket of items - was unchanged. Stripping out food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate and mask wider trends, prices rose by 0.2%, easing from a month earlier.
											<br>
											
											Stocks surged following the report, as investors bet the US central bank will not have to do more to cool the economy to slow inflation.</p>

										<p>New detail on just how much Google is willing to pay to be a go-to search engine has slipped out in court in the US, where the tech giant is on trial defending itself from monopoly claims.
											<br>

											An expert testifying on behalf of Google said it sends 36% of the advertising revenue it makes on Apple's Safari web browser to the iPhone maker.
											
											The relationship between the two firms is at the heart of the monopoly case.
											<br>
											
											Prosecutors say their dealings have illegally restricted competition.
											
											The lead lawyer for Google "visibly cringed" when the specific share of ad revenue sent to Apple was revealed, according to Bloomberg.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Google has maintained that its dominance of online searches is due to having a superior product.
											
											The high-stakes trial pitting Google against the US Department of Justice started in September.
											 Many of the proceedings have been shielded from public view, to protect trade secrets.
											
											But some details have emerged.
											<br>
											
											All told, Google paid more than $26bn to other companies, including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, be installed as the default search engine, according to statements heard at the trial.
											
											Analysts on Wall Street have estimated that amounted to more than $18bn for Apple alone..</p>

												The government has lifted the price it pays from £44 per MWh to £73.
												
												It is hoped that more offshore wind capacity will lead to cheaper energy bills.
												
												Companies have said that the cost of building wind farms has soared because of rising inflation and interest rates, while the maximum price they can charge for the electricity they generate has been relatively low..</p>

											<p>UK inflation fell sharply in October to its lowest rate in two years, largely due to lower energy prices.

												Inflation, which measures the rate at which consumer prices rise, dropped to 4.6% in the year to October, down from 6.7% the month before.
												
												The government says its pledge to halve inflation by end of the year has been met early.
												
												But there is a limit to how much credit ministers can take for the fall as energy prices settle.
												
												Economists have said the main reason inflation has fallen from its peak of 11.1% in October 2022 is due to a fall this month in the energy price cap, which limits what suppliers can charge consumers per unit of energy.</p>
