										<h2>BBC goes inside Al-Shifa hospital with the Israeli army</h2>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1655B/production/_131738419_alshifa-3.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
									<br>
									<br>
										<p>We clamber into the Al-Shifa hospital complex in darkness over a caved-in wall in the perimeter - knocked through with an armoured bulldozer on Tuesday to allow safer access for Israeli forces.
											<br>

											The BBC and one other television crew were the first journalists invited by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to view what Israel says it has found at the site. <br>
											<br>
											
											Any extra light here is risky so we grope our way through the compound, following the heavily armed troops sent to escort us - stepping around makeshift tents, debris and sleeping people.
											<br>
											
											Doctors at the hospital say they have been working without power, food or water for days now - and that critically ill patients have died as a result, including newborn babies. People displaced by the fighting in Gaza have been sheltering in the hospital complex.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											
											But Israel says Hamas also runs a network of underground tunnels, including under Al-Shifa hospital.

The masked special forces leading us into the building over debris and broken glass are a sign of how tense the situation still is here.
<br>
<br> Our presence, just a day after Israel took control of the hospital, speaks volumes about Israel's motivation to show the world why they are here.

In the brightly lit corridors of the MRI unit, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus shows us three small stashes of Kalashnikovs, <br> ammunition and bullet-proof vests - he says they have found around 15 guns in all, along with some grenades.
<br>
<br>
Lt Col Conricus also shows us some military booklets and pamphlets, and a map that he says is marked with potential entry and exit routes from the hospital.

										<h3>Ukraine war: Army claims foothold on bank of Dnipro river in south</h3>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F41C/production/_131729426_gettyimages-1773655376.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
										<br>
										<br>
										<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak has said that Ukrainian forces have gained a foothold on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro river.
											<br>
											<br>

											Russia has admitted that some Ukrainian forces have set up positions in a village but claims they will soon be wiped out.
											
											If the area is held it would mean a significant advance for Ukraine.
											
											Russia retreated from the right bank of the river a year ago.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The Ukrainian army has since been trying to create and hold a bridgehead on its eastern shore.
											
											"The Armed Forces of Ukraine captured a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro," Mr Yermak told a US think tank, using a military term for a secured position.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											US-based experts said earlier that marginal advances had been made into the village of Krynky, 2km (1.25 miles) inland from the river and 30km from the city of Kherson, recaptured a year ago.
											
											Russia conceded on Wednesday that "small groups" of Ukrainian forces had set up positions in the village on the left bank.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											But Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed official in charge of the Kherson region still under occupation, insisted that they had sustained heavy losses and faced a "fiery hell" and had no chance of breaking through. "Our additional forces have now been brought in. The enemy is trapped in Krynky," he claimed.

											<br>
											<br>
											
											His admission that Ukrainian forces had gained a foothold came two days after Russian state media bizarrely published and then swiftly retracted news of a retreat from positions on the left bank.

										<h3>Ukraine uses US-supplied ATACMS for the first time, says Zelensky</h3>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15531/production/_131454378_mediaitem131454377.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
										<p>Ukraine has used US-supplied long-range missiles for the first time, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

											His comments follow reports the weapons, known as ATACMS, destroyed nine helicopters at Russian bases in the east of the country. Ukraine has not confirmed the missiles were used.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Ukraine said an air defence system and other equipment were among the targets hit in Berdyansk and Luhansk.
											
											Dozens of Russian troops were killed or injured in the operation, it added.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											"They have performed very accurately. ATACMS have proven themselves," Mr Zelensky said in an evening address posted on social media, without giving details of when or where they were used.
											
											Russia's military has not commented.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The Biden administration had previously refused to provide ATACMS to Ukraine, but had decided "in recent weeks" to send them quietly, US media outlet CNN reported, quoting two US officials.
											
											It said that Washington wanted to take Moscow by surprise, in case Russia moved equipment and weapons out of reach before the projectiles could be used.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Because of concerns about tensions with Russia, the missiles provided to Ukraine have a lower range than the maximum the system is capable of, according to the Associated Press.</p>

								<h3>Russia strikes civilian ship in Black Sea port of Odesa - Ukraine</h3>
								<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86DD/production/_131652543_boatdamage1.png.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
								<p>According to the southern defence forces, the Liberian-flagged vessel was struck by an anti-radar missile.

									A 43-year-old harbour pilot died, while three Filipino crewmembers and a port worker have been injured.
									
									There was no immediate comment from Russia on the incident.
									<br>
									<br>
									
									According to Odesa's Regional Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating, the attack was launched at 16:45 local time (14:45 GMT) on Wednesday. The ship was reportedly moored at the time it was struck.
									
									One of the injured workers was hospitalised.
									<br>
									<br>
									
									Ukraine's Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on social media that the ship was supposed to be transporting iron ore to China.
									
									Vessels entering and leaving the port of Odesa have been at risk of Russian attack since Moscow pulled out of a deal earlier this year that allowed for the safe export of Ukrainian grain.
									<br>
									<br>
									Ukraine has since opened a temporary corridor to allow vessels to come and go from its ports.
									
									The Russian defence ministry said it regards all cargo ships in the Black Sea bound for Ukraine as potential military targets.
								
									
									According to Mr Kubrakov, Wednesday's attack is the 21st targeted assault on port infrastructure since Russia withdrew from the deal in July.
									<br>
									<br>
									
									At least eight people were wounded and a historic museum was damaged on Sunday during Russian airstrikes on Odesa, Ukrainian officials said.</p>

								<h1 class="Ho">Ukraine war: Russia goes back to prisons to feed its war machine</h1>
								<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D590/production/_131527645_gettyimages-1258817415.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;" >

											<br>
										<p>The Russian defence ministry has been recruiting prisoners to fight in Ukraine, apparently taking over from the Wagner mercenary group which was the first to adopt the practice last year.
											<br>
											<br>

											Such army units are commonly known as Storm-Z, the letter Z being one of the symbols of Vladimir Putin's so-called "special military operation" against Ukraine. It is also the first letter of the Russian word "zek", or "inmate".
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The name Storm-Z is unofficial and can be applied to a range of Russian army units active in different parts of Ukraine.
											
											Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, Storm-Z detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle - with little consideration for the lives of their servicemen.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											There are also indications that members of other army units can be sent to Storm-Z detachments as punishment for violations such as insubordination or drunkenness.</p>

												<h3>Ukraine war: Russians likely targeted Khmelnytsky nuclear plant - Zelensky</h3>
												<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F89B/production/_131534636_7094d987821d52c61c43d6832e22e6457bcd93e20_349_7424_41741000x563.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
												<br>
											<br>
										<p>A Russian drone attack on western Ukraine likely targeted a nuclear power plant, President Volodymyr Zelensky says.

											Iranian-designed Shahed drones struck the area around the power plant in the western Khmelnytsky region early on Wednesday, he said.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The attack injured 20 people and caused light damage, including broken windows.
											
											The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the plant's operations were unaffected.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											"Powerful explosions shook an area near Ukraine's Khmelnytsky Nuclear Power Plant," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement. The blasts highlight "the dangers to nuclear safety" posed by the war, he added.
											
											The Khmelnytsky plant has two reactors. One is operating and one has been in planned outage since August.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Fears of fighting affecting a nuclear power plant have been omnipresent since Russia first invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
											
											Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in eastern Ukraine, since March 2022.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Kyiv accuses Russia of shelling the plant and risking a radiation leak, behaviour it characterises as "nuclear terror". No serious accident has occurred since the full-scale invasion last year, however.
											
											Mr Zelensky said the attack in the Khmelnytsky region showed that Ukraine's air defences needed further support from international partners.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											He added that Russian drones and missiles contained components originating from Western companies and countries and the Khmelnytsky strike showed "how dangerous it can be when Russia can bypass international sanctions".
											
											On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a €1.4bn ($1.5bn; £1.2bn) aid package for Ukraine.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The new aid will include missile defence systems with the aim of creating a "protective shield" around Ukrainian infrastructure, given Russian plans "to use the cold and energy shortages as weapons against the civilian population", he said.</p>

										<h3>Ukraine war: Russian state media retract report of retreat</h3>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E15A/production/_131709675_gettyimages-1773653958.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;" >
										<br>
											<br>
										<p>Russian state media on Monday published and swiftly retracted reports of a withdrawal of forces from positions on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro River.

											The reports quoted Russia's defence ministry announcing troops were being transferred "to more favourable positions" on the Russian-occupied left - or eastern - side.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											The stories were quickly retracted.
											
											The Russian defence ministry blamed the "false report" on Ukraine.
											
											Ukraine claimed the announcement was a Russian disinformation operation being carried out against it.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Monday's hasty reversal took place almost exactly a year after Russian forces withdrew their troops from the right bank, including from the city of Kherson. The river largely continues to separate Ukrainian and Russian forces.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											In the now-retracted reports, state news agencies Tass and RIA-Novosti said Russia had repositioned troops to positions east of the Dnipro river, in order to "free up some of its forces, which will be used for offensive operations in other areas".
											
											
											They reflected similar language to those used in previous announcements of Russian retreats.</p>

													<p>In any warzone, counting the dead is a challenge. Gaza is no different.

											<br>
											<br>
											<p>UK inflation fell sharply in October to its lowest rate in two years, largely due to lower energy prices. <br>

												Inflation, which measures the rate at which consumer prices rise, dropped to 4.6% in the year to October, down from 6.7% the month before.
												<br>
												The government says its pledge to halve inflation by end of the year has been met early.
												
												But there is a limit to how much credit ministers can take for the fall as energy prices settle. <br>
												
												Economists have said the main reason inflation has fallen from its peak of 11.1% in October 2022 is due to a fall this month in the energy price cap, <br> which limits what suppliers can charge consumers per unit of energy.</p>
